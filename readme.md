# Github repo to learn Cache utilization of the Employees DB. 

1. It is a public repo
2. Usage is limited to Oracle DB. Can be configured to Mysql OR H2 DB in application Configurations.
3. ~~Don't fork my repo as my updates will be gone :angry:~~ will be reviewed later if you push new update.
4. ~~Docker image coming soon ... :smirk:~~ It is private but created including Gradle Image :boom:
5. Added Swagger UI . Please use **/swagger-ui/index.html** as endpoint.

Normal Tests are being written now.
Once I have time to learn Mockito , will be implemented for all classes. :grin:
