2. usage is limited to Oracle DB. Can be configured to Mysql OR H2 DB in application CConfigurations.
3. ~~dont fork my repo as my updates will be gone :angry:~~ will be reviewed later if you push new update.
4. ~~Docker image coming soon ... :smirk:~~ It is private but created including Gradle Image :boom:

Normal Tests are being written now.
